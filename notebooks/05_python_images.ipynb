As a side note, the only datatype that Pillow can work with is uint8. Matplotlib plotting can handle float32 and uint8, but image reading/writing for any format other than PNG is limited to uint8 data. Why 8 bits? Most displays can only render 8 bits per channel worth of color gradation. Why can they only render 8 bits/channel? Because that's about all the human eye can see.

An RGBA (where A is alpha, or transparency), has 4 values per inner list, and a simple luminance image just has one value (and is thus only a 2-D array, not a 3-D array). For RGB and RGBA images, Matplotlib supports float32 and uint8 data types. For grayscale, Matplotlib supports only float32.  If your array data does not meet one of these descriptions, you need to rescale it."

    "### Array Interpolation schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolation calculates what the color or value of a pixel \"should\" be, according to different mathematical schemes. One common place that this happens is when you resize an image. The number of pixels change, but you want the same information. Since pixels are discrete, there's missing space. Interpolation is how you fill that space. This is why your images sometimes come out looking pixelated when you blow them up. The effect is more pronounced when the difference between the original image and the expanded image is greater. Let's take our image and shrink it. We're effectively discarding pixels, only keeping a select few. Now when we plot it, that data gets blown up to the size on your screen. The old pixels aren't there anymore, and the computer has to draw in pixels to fill that space."
