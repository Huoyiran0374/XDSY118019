## What is Markdown?

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a **lightweight markup language** for creating formatted text using a **plain-text** editor.

- John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is **appealing to human readers in its source code form**.
- Its key design goal was **readability**, that the language be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions, unlike text formatted with ‘heavier’ markup languages, such as Rich Text Format (RTF), HTML, and XML.
- Markdown file often ends with extension `.md`.
